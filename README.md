# Make-it-Stand-with-Quadrics

How do we ensure a 3D printed object can stand in a desired orientation but still  closely approximate the original target shape? 
This results in a cool shape (and density) optimization problem with a surprisingly simple class of solutions. Exploring how shape and 
density affect stability will involve learning many fundamentals in geometric processing and 
optimization!
